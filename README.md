Forgot to publish timely. Published on 8th July

PACMAN implementation using SDL2. 
This implementation includes heavy use of OOP. As this was a course on Design Practices, I have focussed on working for the best design possile.
OOP concepts helped a lot.

There is a Makefile in the folder which compiles all the files and build an executable. All of this automatically happens with make command.

Running instruction:
Download the whole folder, and just run "make" for the Game to run. Make sure to install SDL2.
OS: Ubuntu 2020

Links: I really don't remember where all I went for help, mostly it were some random websites for different problems I faced. But, there is nothing in the game that is directly copied from any website, it's  my own work. But I did refer to different websites according to the requirement through the design process.
