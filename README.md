PACMAN implementation using SDL2. 

There is a Makefile in the folder which compiles all the files and build an executable. All of this automatically happens with "make" command(including running the executable).

Running instruction:
Download the whole folder, and just run "make" for the Game to run. Make sure to install SDL2.
OS: Ubuntu 2020

Links: I really don't remember where all I went for help, mostly it were some random websites for specific problems I faced during the work. But, there is nothing in the game that is directly copied from any website. It's  my own work. I did refer to different websites according to the requirement during the design process.
